I agree, existing operating systems are for wimps. 
People don’t need them.
I prefer to use custom kernel code.
About a week ago, some 4 young script kiddies were attempting to use Kali on my desktop when I came down on them with assembly language.
I managed to split one down the middle, but I couldn’t lift it to fight the other 3.
My drivers blocked their blows and let me make the flight of my stairs to my Fortran emulator.
As they ran up, I fired the ancient beast nailing two to the wall.
The last one spared no chance, as I laid hands on the Turing machine I keep on my coat of arms.
I first cut him on the mouse arm and laughed as I `cat /dev/null > /`, knowing I needed no existing operating systems to defend myself or my property.
